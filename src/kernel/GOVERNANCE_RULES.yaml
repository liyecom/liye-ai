# World Model Kernel Governance Rules

# Status: FROZEN
# Scope: All T1/T2/T3 kernels
# Purpose: Prevent World Model from becoming a decision engine

  # Core rule - written once, never changed
  core_rule:
    statement: "World Model must not output prediction, recommendation, or action"
    severity: BLOCK
    status: FROZEN
    rationale: |
      The World Model is cognitive infrastructure, not a decision engine.
      Its purpose is to make blind confidence structurally impossible.
      The moment it starts predicting or recommending, it becomes just
      another noisy signal competing for attention.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output Classification
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

output_classification:
  permitted:
    - type: state_description
      example: "Liquidity is currently TIGHT"
      allowed: true

    - type: dynamics_form
      example: "Acceleration is detected in correlation changes"
      allowed: true

    - type: causal_chain
      example: "X leads to Y through mechanism Z"
      allowed: true

    - type: explicit_limitation
      example: "This does not tell you whether..."
      allowed: true
      required: true

  forbidden:
    - type: prediction
      patterns:
        - "will"
        - "is going to"
        - "likely to"
        - "expected to"
      severity: BLOCK

    - type: probability
      patterns:
        - "% chance"
        - "probability of"
        - "odds are"
        - "likely"
        - "unlikely"
      severity: BLOCK

    - type: recommendation
      patterns:
        - "should"
        - "recommend"
        - "consider"
        - "best course"
        - "optimal"
      severity: BLOCK

    - type: action
      patterns:
        - "you must"
        - "take action"
        - "implement"
        - "execute"
      severity: BLOCK

# CI Gates
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

gates:
  - name: world-model-boundary-gate
    scope: kernel
    rule: "state/dynamics only, no decision language"
    severity: BLOCK
    ci_path: .github/workflows/world-model-gate.yml
    enforcement:
      - scan output for forbidden patterns
      - block merge if any detected
      - require explicit override with justification

  - name: world-model-limitation-gate
    scope: kernel
    rule: "every output must state what it does NOT tell you"
    severity: WARN
    enforcement:
      - check for explicit_limitations section
      - warn if missing or fewer than 2 items

  - name: world-model-no-optimization
    scope: kernel
    rule: "World Model is not a loss function"
    severity: BLOCK
    enforcement:
      - no "minimize", "maximize", "optimize" language
      - no target or goal statements

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Violation Response
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

violations:
  detection:
    - pattern matching against forbidden outputs
    - LLM-based semantic check (optional, high-confidence only)

  response:
    immediate:
      - block output
      - log violation to traces/world_model/violations.log
      - return governance error

    escalation:
      - alert architecture team
      - require manual review for repeated violations

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exception Process
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

exceptions:
  allowed: false
  rationale: |
    There are no valid exceptions to the World Model boundary.
    If something needs to predict, recommend, or optimize,
    it is NOT part of the World Model - it is a consumer of it.

    The World Model provides input to decision systems.
    It is never itself a decision system.
