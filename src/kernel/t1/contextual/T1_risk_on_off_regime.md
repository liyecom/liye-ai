# Risk-On / Risk-Off Regime Mechanism

Markets periodically shift between two distinct regimes:
risk-on (return-seeking dominates) and risk-off (safety-seeking dominates),
with different asset behavior patterns in each regime.

## Causal Chain

**Risk-On Regime:**
1. Low volatility / positive sentiment → Risk appetite increases
2. Risk appetite → Flow into equities, credit, EM
3. Flow into risk assets → Returns attract more flow
4. Self-reinforcing → Regime persists until shock

**Risk-Off Regime:**
1. Shock / uncertainty spike → Risk aversion triggers
2. Risk aversion → Flow into treasuries, gold, JPY, USD
3. Safe haven flows → Risk assets sell off
4. Correlation spike → Diversification fails

## Boundary Condition

**Applies when:**
- Global macro factors dominate
- Institutional cross-asset allocation active
- Risk metrics (VIX, credit spreads) are primary signals

**Breaks down in:**
- Idiosyncratic, stock-specific events
- Sector rotation within risk-on regime
- Gradual, well-anticipated policy changes

## Falsifiability

Compare cross-asset correlation:
- During VIX < 15 periods (risk-on)
- During VIX > 30 periods (risk-off)

Prediction: Risk-on shows low/negative correlation between risky/safe assets;
Risk-off shows high correlation (all risky assets down together).
