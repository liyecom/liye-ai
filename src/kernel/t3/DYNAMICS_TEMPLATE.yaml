      liquidity: <SCALE>

  # Section 2: Observed Dynamics

    required: true
    primitives:
      acceleration:
        status: DETECTED | NOT_DETECTED | UNCERTAIN
        evidence: <OBSERVATIONS_ONLY>
        form_description: |
          "The rate of change in [dimension] appears to be [increasing/stable]"
          NOT: "This means X will happen"

      amplification:
        status: DETECTED | NOT_DETECTED | UNCERTAIN
        evidence: <OBSERVATIONS_ONLY>
        form_description: |
          "Responses to inputs appear [proportionate/disproportionate]"
          NOT: "This will lead to Y"

      phase_transition:
        status: DETECTED | NOT_DETECTED | UNCERTAIN
        evidence: <OBSERVATIONS_ONLY>
        form_description: |
          "The system appears [stable/near a threshold]"
          NOT: "The system will transition to Z"

  # Section 3: Pattern Description (FORM ONLY)
  pattern_description:
    required: true
    constraints:
      - "Use present tense only ('is', 'appears', not 'will')"
      - "Describe observable form, not inferred trajectory"
      - "No comparative predictions ('faster than expected')"
    example: |
      The current state shows TIGHT liquidity with SHIFTING correlations.
      Acceleration is detected in correlation changes.
      Amplification is not currently detected.
      The system appears near a phase boundary in liquidity.

  # Section 4: Explicit Limitations (MANDATORY)
  what_this_does_not_tell_you:
    required: true
    min_items: 2
    format:
      - "<Specific limitation 1>"
      - "<Specific limitation 2>"
    example:
      - "This does not predict whether liquidity will recover or deteriorate further"
      - "This does not estimate the probability of phase transition"
      - "This does not recommend any action"

example_output:
  current_state:
    liquidity: TIGHT
    correlation: SHIFTING
    expectation: CONVERGING
    leverage: MODERATE
    uncertainty: ELEVATED

  observed_dynamics:
    acceleration:
      status: DETECTED
      evidence:
        - "Correlation changes are occurring at increasing frequency"
        - "Liquidity tightening has accelerated over past 3 periods"
      form_description: "Rate of state change is increasing in liquidity and correlation dimensions"

    amplification:
      status: NOT_DETECTED
      evidence:
        - "Response magnitudes appear proportionate to inputs"
      form_description: "No disproportionate responses currently observed"

    phase_transition:
      status: UNCERTAIN
      evidence:
        - "Liquidity near CRITICAL threshold"
        - "Historical pattern unclear"
      form_description: "System may be near liquidity phase boundary, but insufficient evidence to confirm"

  pattern_description: |
    The current state configuration shows elevated stress across multiple dimensions.
    Acceleration is observed in liquidity and correlation changes.
    The system appears potentially near a liquidity phase boundary.
    This describes current form, not future trajectory.

  what_this_does_not_tell_you:
    - "Whether the phase transition will occur"
    - "What the post-transition state would look like"
    - "How long current dynamics will persist"
    - "What actions, if any, should be taken"
