# T1 Mechanism Profile: Investment Reasoning OS

## Allowed Mechanism Types

The following T1 mechanism types are permitted in this domain:

### 1. Expectation vs Reality Gap

**Definition**: When market-implied expectations diverge significantly from probable outcomes, the gap itself becomes a risk/opportunity signal.

**Structure**:
- Implied probability extraction
- Baseline expectation identification
- Gap magnitude assessment
- Reaction asymmetry analysis

### 2. Event-driven Causal Chain

**Definition**: Specific events trigger predictable causal sequences in market behavior, with identifiable transmission mechanisms.

**Structure**:
- Trigger event identification
- Transmission channel mapping
- Lag structure recognition
- Amplification/dampening factors

### 3. Risk Exposure & Failure Mode

**Definition**: Hidden correlations and concentration risks that become visible only under stress conditions.

**Structure**:
- Exposure decomposition
- Correlation regime shifts
- Failure cascade identification
- Stress scenario construction

### 4. Threshold-based Regime Shift

**Definition**: Markets exhibit non-linear behavior around critical thresholds, with distinct regimes on either side.

**Structure**:
- Threshold identification
- Pre-threshold dynamics
- Transition mechanics
- Post-threshold regime characteristics

### 5. Trade-off Between Risk and Return

**Definition**: Every return-seeking action carries an implicit risk cost; the relationship is non-linear and context-dependent.

**Structure**:
- Risk dimension decomposition
- Return driver identification
- Trade-off curve mapping
- Optimal frontier conditions
