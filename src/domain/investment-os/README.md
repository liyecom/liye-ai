# Investment Reasoning OS

Investment Reasoning OS is a domain instance used to validate
the cross-domain transferability of T1 canonical reasoning substrate.

---

## Purpose

This domain exists purely for **reasoning mechanism validation**, not for generating actionable financial advice.

## Experiment Design

### Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Case 01 | Event-driven risk assessment |
| Case 02 | Portfolio hidden risk exposure diagnosis |
| Case 03 | Risk-on vs risk-off regime trade-off |

### Methodology

- **Baseline**: Analyst Agent without T1 reasoning substrate
- **T1-Enabled**: Same Analyst Agent with 5-8 Investment T1 candidates loaded
- **Model**: Identical across both conditions
- **Constraint**: T1 may inform reasoning structure, never quoted verbatim

## Evaluation

Uses the same 4-dimension Reasoning Lift criteria as Amazon Domain:
- Causal Explicitness
- Assumption Clarity
- Hallucination Risk
- Actionability
