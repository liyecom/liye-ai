# Reflexivity Loop Mechanism

Market prices influence fundamentals, which in turn influence prices,
creating self-reinforcing loops that can amplify both booms and busts
beyond what "fundamentals alone" would justify.

## Causal Chain

**Positive loop (boom):**
1. Rising prices → Improved collateral values
2. Improved collateral → Easier credit access
3. Easier credit → More buying power
4. More buying power → Further price increases

**Negative loop (bust):**
1. Falling prices → Impaired collateral
2. Impaired collateral → Margin calls / credit tightening
3. Credit tightening → Forced selling
4. Forced selling → Further price declines

## Boundary Condition

**Applies when:**
- Significant leverage in the system
- Collateral values tied to asset prices
- Credit availability responds to prices

**Breaks down in:**
- Unleveraged markets
- Assets not used as collateral
- Central bank intervention breaks the loop

## Falsifiability

Compare price-credit dynamics during:
- Housing boom 2004-2006 (reflexive)
- Treasury market normal conditions (less reflexive)

Prediction: Leverage-sensitive assets show stronger price momentum.
