# Asymmetric Information Decay Mechanism

The value of information decays asymmetrically:
positive information is incorporated gradually,
while negative information is incorporated rapidly,
creating predictable asymmetry in price dynamics.

## Causal Chain

**Positive information:**
1. Good news arrives → Skepticism / verification needed
2. Verification → Gradual buying over days/weeks
3. Gradual buying → Slow price appreciation
4. Slow appreciation → Momentum extends

**Negative information:**
1. Bad news arrives → Immediate risk aversion
2. Risk aversion → Rapid selling in hours/days
3. Rapid selling → Sharp price decline
4. Sharp decline → Overshoot possible

## Boundary Condition

**Applies when:**
- Information is ambiguous or complex
- Asymmetric payoff to being wrong (career risk)
- Institutions dominate trading

**Breaks down in:**
- Crystal-clear binary events
- Retail-dominated markets
- Extremely positive news with no ambiguity

## Falsifiability

Compare price adjustment speed:
- Time to incorporate positive earnings surprise
- Time to incorporate negative earnings surprise

Prediction: Negative surprises should be fully reflected in 1-2 days;
positive surprises may take 1-2 weeks for full incorporation.
