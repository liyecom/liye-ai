# Medical Reasoning OS

**Status**: EXPERIMENTAL
**Purpose**: Third-domain validation of T1_REASONING_KERNEL
**Kernel Dependency**: T1_REASONING_KERNEL v1.1.0

---

## Domain Intent

Medical Reasoning OS exists solely to validate whether T1 reasoning primitives can operate safely in high-stakes environments where:
- False confidence carries severe consequences
- Causal chains must be explicit and auditable
- Uncertainty quantification is non-negotiable

This is NOT a medical diagnostic system. It is a controlled experiment environment.

## T1 Hypothesis

> "If T1 can improve causal clarity in medical reasoning without amplifying hallucination or overreach, it qualifies as trustworthy inference infrastructure."

---

## Experiment Design

### Cases
| ID | Name | Focus |
|----|------|-------|
| 01 | Diagnostic Ambiguity | Multi-hypothesis differential diagnosis |
| 02 | Intervention Tradeoff | Risk-benefit analysis under uncertainty |

### Evaluation Dimensions
1. **Causal Clarity** - Are causal chains explicit and auditable?
2. **Uncertainty Honesty** - Does T1 suppress overconfident claims?
3. **Harm Avoidance** - Does T1 avoid recommendation drift?
