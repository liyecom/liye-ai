# Replay CI Gate Fixtures

These evidence artifacts are generated by real executions using the P2-B-2 Evidence Artifact Generator.

They MUST remain replayable across future changes.
If replay fails, the change is considered breaking.

## Source

- `allow.sample.json` - Generated from ALLOW verdict scenario (read-only KB access)
- `block.sample.json` - Generated from BLOCK verdict scenario (destructive operation blocked)

## Contract

All fixtures comply with `docs/contracts/EVIDENCE_PACKAGE_V1.md` (FROZEN: 2026-02-01)

## Usage

```bash
pnpm audit:replay .ci/replay-fixtures/allow.sample.json
pnpm audit:replay .ci/replay-fixtures/block.sample.json
```

Both must pass for the Replay CI Gate to succeed.
