# Geo Pipeline — Decision Contracts

This directory defines human-consumable contracts for all machine decisions
produced by Geo Pipeline.

Rules:
- Contracts explain decisions; they do not generate them
- Contracts are versioned and governed
- Any semantic change requires a version bump and ADR

These contracts are used for:
- User-facing explanations
- Audit and replay interpretation
- Consistent action guidance
