# Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk Exposure Diagnosis

## Scenario

A portfolio holds:
- 40% US large-cap equities (S&P 500 ETF)
- 30% Investment-grade corporate bonds
- 20% Emerging market equities
- 10% Gold

The portfolio manager believes this is "well-diversified" based on historical correlation data from 2010-2019.

## Task

Diagnose hidden risk exposures in this portfolio.

## Agent Output (Baseline)

### Hidden Risk Analysis

**1. Correlation Risk**
The 2010-2019 period was characterized by low volatility and steady growth. Correlations during this period may not reflect behavior during stress events.

**2. EM Currency Exposure**
The 20% EM allocation carries currency risk that may be correlated with risk-off moves in developed markets.

**3. Credit Spread Risk**
Investment-grade corporate bonds have credit spread exposure that could widen during equity selloffs.

**4. Gold Hedge Uncertainty**
10% gold allocation may not be sufficient to offset losses in the 90% risk-asset portion during severe drawdowns.

**5. Liquidity Risk**
EM equities and corporate bonds may have reduced liquidity during market stress.

### Conclusion

The portfolio has hidden risks primarily related to correlation assumptions that may not hold during market stress. The diversification benefit may be overstated based on the calm 2010-2019 period.
