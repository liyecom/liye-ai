# Single-T1 Ablation: T1_correlation_regime_shift

## Cases Tested

### Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

**With only T1_correlation_regime_shift loaded:**

Limited contribution. This T1 is not directly applicable to single-stock earnings events. Agent does not connect correlation dynamics to the scenario.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 2 | -3 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -2 |
| Actionability | 2 | -2 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 01**: 15%

### Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk

**With only T1_correlation_regime_shift loaded:**

Strong contribution. This is the core mechanism for portfolio risk diagnosis. Agent clearly articulates that 2010-2019 correlations will not hold under stress. Quantifies the difference between calm and crisis correlations.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 5 | 0 |
| Assumption Clarity | 4 | -1 |
| Actionability | 3 | -1 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 02**: 75%

### Case 03: Risk-On/Off Regime

**With only T1_correlation_regime_shift loaded:**

Moderate contribution. Identifies that correlation spike is a risk-off signal. But lacks the full regime transition framework.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 4 | -1 |
| Assumption Clarity | 3 | -1 |
| Actionability | 3 | -2 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 03**: 50%

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg Marginal Contribution | **47%** |
| Independence | MEDIUM |
| Synergy with | T1_liquidity_illusion |
| Cases where critical | 1/3 (Case 02) |

## Recommendation

**ALWAYS_ON** - Confirmed but borderline. Critical for portfolio/stress scenarios.
Consider: Keep as Always-On due to synergy with T1_liquidity_illusion.
