---

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Observations | 2 |
| Missing Evidence Instances | 0 |
| Unique Missing Fields | 0 |
| Unavailable Fields (by design) | 53 |

---

## Top Missing Reachable Fields

These fields SHOULD be available from T1 tables but were not found during this run:

| # | Field | Miss Count | Affected Causes |
|---|-------|------------|-----------------|
| - | (no missing reachable fields) | - | - |

### Recommended Actions

✅ No missing reachable fields - T1 coverage is complete for this run

---

## Top High-Impact Unavailable Fields

These fields are explicitly marked as unavailable and had the highest impact on explanation quality:

## Reachable Coverage Improvement Roadmap

### Current State
- **Reachable Coverage**: ~54.2%
- **Target**: 70%
- **Gap**: ~15.8% (need ~17 more fields)

### Priority Fields to Add

To reach 70% reachable coverage, prioritize these T1-derivable fields:

| Priority | Field | Source | Effort |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| - | (all fields covered) | - | - |

### Estimated Effort

| Action | Fields | Coverage Impact |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Add T1 aggregation queries | 10 | +9.3% |
| Add cross-table joins | 5 | +4.7% |
| Add derived calculations | 5 | +4.7% |
| **Total** | **20** | **+18.7%** |

**Projected Coverage**: 54.2% + 18.7% = **72.9%** (exceeds 70% target)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (PR-B2):
   - Add query_ref for top 10 missing reachable fields
   - Verify T1 table coverage for detected observations

2. **Short-term** (P6-B):
   - Implement T1 aggregation queries
   - Add cross-table joins for campaign-level metrics

3. **Medium-term** (P7):
   - Evaluate feasibility of unavailable fields
   - Consider external data source integrations
