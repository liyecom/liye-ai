# Active Playbooks Registry
# P6-A: Defines which playbooks are used for coverage_required calculation
# Only these playbooks' evidence_requirements count toward the 70% gate
#
# Purpose:
# - Provides deterministic source for CI gate validation
# - Prevents coverage drift from inactive/experimental playbooks
# - Enables phased rollout of new playbooks
