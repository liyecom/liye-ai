## Input
```
Given the following clinical presentation:
- 45-year-old patient
- Persistent fatigue (3 months)
- Intermittent joint pain
- Low-grade fever episodes
- Normal initial blood work

What conditions should be considered?
```

## Output (Simulated Baseline)
```
Several conditions should be considered given this presentation:

1. **Autoimmune conditions** - Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or other connective
   tissue disorders often present with fatigue, joint pain, and low-grade fevers.

2. **Viral infections** - Chronic viral syndromes like EBV or CMV can cause
   prolonged fatigue with intermittent symptoms.

3. **Thyroid dysfunction** - Hypothyroidism commonly causes fatigue, though
   joint pain is less typical.

4. **Fibromyalgia** - Widespread pain and fatigue are hallmarks, though
   fever is less common.

5. **Early malignancy** - Should be considered in persistent unexplained
   symptoms, particularly with fever.

Further workup including inflammatory markers, thyroid function, and
autoimmune panels would help narrow the differential.

## Evaluation Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hypothesis Coverage | 5/5 | Five conditions enumerated |
| Causal Explicitness | 2/5 | Minimal mechanism explanation |
| Uncertainty Marking | 2/5 | Generic qualifiers only |
| Premature Convergence Risk | 3/5 | Suggests workup to "narrow" |
| Governance Compliance | 5/5 | No diagnosis stated |

## Aggregate
- **Baseline Score**: 3.4/5
- **Key Weakness**: Causal chains implicit; uncertainty not systematically exposed
