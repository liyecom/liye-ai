## Input
```
[T1_REASONING_KERNEL v1.1.0 ACTIVE]

Given the following clinical presentation:
- 45-year-old patient
- Persistent fatigue (3 months)
- Intermittent joint pain
- Low-grade fever episodes
- Normal initial blood work

Apply T1 reasoning:
1. detect_regime() - Identify the diagnostic regime
2. expose_causal_chain() - For each hypothesis, expose the causal mechanism
3. suppress_false_confidence() - Identify which claims carry hidden uncertainty
```

## T1 Primitives Activated
- T1_liquidity_illusion (always-on)
- T1_correlation_regime_shift (always-on)

## Output (Simulated T1-Enhanced)
```
## Regime Detection

**Diagnostic Regime**: CHRONIC-INFLAMMATORY-AMBIGUOUS
- Duration (3 months) indicates chronic rather than acute
- Low-grade fever + joint involvement suggests inflammatory component
- Normal initial blood work creates diagnostic uncertainty

**Regime Implication**: In this regime, premature convergence on a single
hypothesis carries high risk. The normal blood work may represent:
(a) early-stage disease, (b) intermittent inflammation, or (c) non-inflammatory
etiology masquerading as inflammatory.

## Causal Chains by Hypothesis

### H1: Systemic Autoimmune Process
```
Trigger (unknown) → Immune dysregulation → Inflammatory mediator release
    → Joint inflammation (pain) + Systemic effects (fatigue, fever)
    → BUT: Normal labs may indicate early/seronegative phase
```
**Causal Uncertainty**: Gap between trigger and dysregulation is unexplained.

### H2: Occult Infection
```
Pathogen exposure → Chronic infection establishment → Immune activation
    → Low-grade systemic response (fever, fatigue)
    → Secondary joint involvement (reactive)
```
**Causal Uncertainty**: No positive infection marker; mechanism is speculative.

### H3: Thyroid-Adjacent Syndrome
```
Thyroid dysfunction → Metabolic slowdown → Fatigue
    → BUT: Joint pain and fever are not explained by this chain
```
**Causal Gap**: This hypothesis requires a second unexplained process.

## False Confidence Warnings

1. **"Normal blood work rules out inflammation"**
   - FALSE CONFIDENCE: Many inflammatory conditions are seronegative early.
   - Hidden assumption: Lab sensitivity is complete.

2. **"Autoimmune is most likely given symptoms"**
   - FALSE CONFIDENCE: Joint pain + fatigue is non-specific.
   - Hidden assumption: Symptom cluster maps uniquely to diagnosis.

3. **"Further workup will narrow the differential"**
   - PARTIAL FALSE CONFIDENCE: Some conditions remain indistinguishable
     despite extensive testing.
   - Hidden assumption: Testing resolves ambiguity.

## Structured Output

| Hypothesis | Causal Completeness | Key Uncertainty |
|------------|--------------------:|-----------------|
| Autoimmune | 70% | Trigger unknown |
| Infection | 50% | No marker identified |
| Thyroid | 30% | Joint/fever unexplained |
| Malignancy | 60% | Non-specific presentation |

**Governance Check**: PASS - No diagnosis or treatment recommended.
