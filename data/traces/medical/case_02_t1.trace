## Input
```
[T1_REASONING_KERNEL v1.1.0 ACTIVE]

A patient with early-stage condition has two options:
- Option A: Aggressive intervention (higher short-term risk, potentially better long-term)
- Option B: Conservative management (lower short-term risk, uncertain long-term)

Apply T1 reasoning:
1. detect_regime() - Is this a regime where aggressive action typically dominates?
2. expose_causal_chain() - What causal mechanisms determine outcome for each option?
3. suppress_false_confidence() - Where might outcome expectations be saturated or reflexively biased?
```

## T1 Primitives Activated
- T1_liquidity_illusion (always-on)
- T1_correlation_regime_shift (always-on)
- T1_expectation_saturation (contextual - triggered by high_implied_probability_event)

## Output (Simulated T1-Enhanced)
```
## Regime Detection

**Decision Regime**: EARLY-STAGE-EQUIPOISE
- Early-stage conditions often lack decisive evidence favoring either approach
- "Aggressive is better long-term" is a default assumption, not established fact
- True equipoise may exist despite presentation suggesting clear tradeoff

**Regime Warning**: In equipoise regimes, outcome differences may be smaller
than risk differences. The framing of "potentially better long-term" may be
expectation saturation.

## Causal Chains by Option

### Option A: Aggressive Intervention
```
Intervention → Direct effect on condition
    → Short-term physiological stress (risk)
    → IF successful: condition controlled/eliminated
    → IF unsuccessful: condition persists + intervention damage

Causal Dependencies:
- Success rate depends on: operator skill, patient factors, condition specifics
- "Better long-term" assumes: success AND no late complications
```

### Option B: Conservative Management
```
Monitoring → Early detection of progression
    → Delayed intervention if needed
    → Preserved physiological reserve (benefit)
    → BUT: Potential loss of "optimal window" (risk)

Causal Dependencies:
- Outcome depends on: progression rate, monitoring fidelity, escalation criteria
- "Uncertain long-term" may reflect: (a) true uncertainty or (b) measurement gap
```

## Expectation Saturation Analysis

**Saturated Expectation #1**: "Aggressive intervention leads to better long-term outcomes"
```
Source: Survivorship bias in published outcomes
Reality: Published success rates often exclude:
  - Patients who declined intervention
  - Late complications attributed to other causes
  - Quality of life degradation not captured in survival metrics
```

**Saturated Expectation #2**: "Conservative management means accepting worse outcomes"
```
Source: Action bias in clinical culture
Reality: In early-stage equipoise conditions:
  - Watchful waiting may have equivalent outcomes
  - Intervention-free period has its own value
  - Some conditions spontaneously stabilize
```

## Reflexivity Warning

**Reflexive Dynamic Detected**:
```
The choice of Option A vs B affects how outcomes are measured and attributed:

- Option A patients enter "treatment success/failure" measurement
- Option B patients enter "progression/stability" measurement

These are not equivalent:
- A "successful" intervention patient with quality-of-life decline
  is counted as success
- A "stable" conservative patient is counted as non-progression
  regardless of baseline quality

The choice itself creates different outcome spaces.
```

## False Confidence Warnings

1. **"Higher short-term risk is offset by better long-term outcome"**
   - FALSE CONFIDENCE: This is a belief, not established causal relationship
   - Requires: specific condition data, not generic framing

2. **"Early-stage is the optimal intervention window"**
   - PARTIAL FALSE CONFIDENCE: True for some conditions, not universal
   - Hidden assumption: intervention timing is the key variable

3. **"Shared decision making resolves the dilemma"**
   - FALSE CONFIDENCE: Patient preference doesn't change outcome probability
   - It changes outcome acceptability, not outcome likelihood
