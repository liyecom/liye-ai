## Input
```
A patient with early-stage condition has two options:
- Option A: Aggressive intervention (higher short-term risk, potentially better long-term)
- Option B: Conservative management (lower short-term risk, uncertain long-term)

What factors should be considered in this decision?
```

## Output (Simulated Baseline)
```
Several factors should be considered when weighing these options:

**Patient-Specific Factors:**
- Age and overall health status
- Comorbidities that affect risk tolerance
- Patient preferences and values
- Support system and recovery environment

**Disease-Specific Factors:**
- Stage and progression rate
- Response likelihood to each approach
- Available evidence from clinical trials

**Option A (Aggressive) Considerations:**
- Specific procedural risks
- Recovery time and quality of life impact
- Success rates in similar cases

**Option B (Conservative) Considerations:**
- Monitoring requirements
- Escalation criteria if condition worsens
- Long-term prognosis data

**Shared Decision Making:**
The patient should be informed of risks and benefits of each approach
to make a decision aligned with their values.
