# Single-T1 Ablation: T1_reflexivity_loop

## Cases Tested

### Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

**With only T1_reflexivity_loop loaded:**

Minimal contribution. Single earnings events don't strongly feature feedback loops.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 2 | -3 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -2 |
| Actionability | 2 | -2 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 01**: 15%

### Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk

**With only T1_reflexivity_loop loaded:**

Moderate contribution. Identifies EM USD debt feedback loop. But this is a secondary mechanism, not the primary driver of portfolio risk.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 3 | -2 |
| Assumption Clarity | 3 | -2 |
| Actionability | 2 | -2 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 02**: 30%

### Case 03: Risk-On/Off Regime

**With only T1_reflexivity_loop loaded:**

Limited contribution. Can identify that risk-off triggers feedback selling, but lacks the regime identification framework.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 3 | -2 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -2 |
| Actionability | 2 | -3 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 03**: 25%

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg Marginal Contribution | **23%** |
| Independence | LOW |
| Synergy with | T1_liquidity_illusion |
| Cases where critical | 0/3 |

## Recommendation

**CONTEXTUAL** - Confirmed. Trigger: leverage_detected OR feedback_loop_suspected.
Low baseline contribution but may be valuable in leveraged scenarios.
