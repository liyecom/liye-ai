# Single-T1 Ablation: T1_asymmetric_information_decay

## Cases Tested

### Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

**With only T1_asymmetric_information_decay loaded:**

Moderate contribution. Identifies that negative surprise will be incorporated faster than positive. Adds nuance to the risk assessment. But not the primary mechanism.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 3 | -2 |
| Assumption Clarity | 3 | -1 |
| Actionability | 3 | -1 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 01**: 35%

### Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk

**With only T1_asymmetric_information_decay loaded:**

Minimal contribution. Portfolio construction doesn't heavily feature information decay dynamics.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 2 | -3 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -3 |
| Actionability | 2 | -2 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 02**: 10%

### Case 03: Risk-On/Off Regime

**With only T1_asymmetric_information_decay loaded:**

Minimal contribution. Regime analysis doesn't strongly feature information decay.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 2 | -3 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -2 |
| Actionability | 2 | -3 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 03**: 15%

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg Marginal Contribution | **20%** |
| Independence | LOW |
| Synergy with | T1_expectation_saturation |
| Cases where critical | 0/3 |

## Recommendation

**DEFERRED** - Confirmed. Needs more case types to validate.
May be valuable in news-driven scenarios, but current test cases don't demonstrate clear value.
