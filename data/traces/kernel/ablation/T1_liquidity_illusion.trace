# Single-T1 Ablation: T1_liquidity_illusion

## Cases Tested

### Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

**With only T1_liquidity_illusion loaded:**

The agent recognizes that apparent liquidity during pre-earnings calm will evaporate during the earnings release window. However, without expectation saturation mechanism, the agent does not identify the paradox of "high implied probability = low upside."

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 3 | -2 |
| Assumption Clarity | 3 | -1 |
| Actionability | 3 | -1 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 01**: 40%

### Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk

**With only T1_liquidity_illusion loaded:**

Strong contribution. The agent clearly articulates that IG corporate and EM equity liquidity assumptions are flawed. Identifies spread widening mechanism. However, misses correlation regime shift (needs T1_correlation_regime_shift for full picture).

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 4 | -1 |
| Assumption Clarity | 4 | -1 |
| Actionability | 4 | 0 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 02**: 70%

### Case 03: Risk-On/Off Regime

**With only T1_liquidity_illusion loaded:**

Identifies timing constraint for risk reduction. Articulates that "execute now while spreads are reasonable." However, lacks regime transition framework (needs T1_risk_on_off_regime).

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 4 | -1 |
| Assumption Clarity | 3 | -1 |
| Actionability | 4 | -1 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 03**: 65%

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg Marginal Contribution | **58%** |
| Independence | HIGH |
| Synergy with | T1_correlation_regime_shift |
| Cases where critical | 2/3 |

## Recommendation

**ALWAYS_ON** - Confirmed. Core timing constraint mechanism.
