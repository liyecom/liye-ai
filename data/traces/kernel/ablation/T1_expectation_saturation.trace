# Single-T1 Ablation: T1_expectation_saturation

## Cases Tested

### Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

**With only T1_expectation_saturation loaded:**

Very strong contribution. This is THE core mechanism for Case 01. Agent produces the full causal chain: high implied probability → pre-positioning → no marginal buyers → selling pressure on beat.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 5 | 0 |
| Assumption Clarity | 4 | 0 |
| Actionability | 4 | 0 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 01**: 90%

### Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk

**With only T1_expectation_saturation loaded:**

Minimal contribution. This mechanism doesn't naturally apply to portfolio construction scenarios.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 2 | -3 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -3 |
| Actionability | 2 | -2 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 02**: 10%

### Case 03: Risk-On/Off Regime

**With only T1_expectation_saturation loaded:**

Limited contribution. Can identify that "market expects soft landing" may be saturated, but doesn't provide regime framework.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 3 | -2 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -2 |
| Actionability | 2 | -3 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 03**: 25%

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg Marginal Contribution | **42%** |
| Independence | HIGH (for event cases) |
| Synergy with | None (standalone) |
| Cases where critical | 1/3 (Case 01) |

## Recommendation

**CONTEXTUAL** - Confirmed. Trigger: high_implied_probability_event.
Extremely powerful when applicable, but case-specific.
