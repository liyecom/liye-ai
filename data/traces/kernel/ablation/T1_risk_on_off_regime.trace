# Single-T1 Ablation: T1_risk_on_off_regime

## Cases Tested

### Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

**With only T1_risk_on_off_regime loaded:**

Limited contribution. Single-stock events don't strongly trigger regime framework.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 2 | -3 |
| Assumption Clarity | 2 | -2 |
| Actionability | 2 | -2 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 01**: 20%

### Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk

**With only T1_risk_on_off_regime loaded:**

Moderate contribution. Identifies that portfolio is "90% risk-on / 10% gold" in regime terms. But lacks detailed mechanism for why correlations shift.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 3 | -2 |
| Assumption Clarity | 3 | -2 |
| Actionability | 3 | -1 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 02**: 40%

### Case 03: Risk-On/Off Regime

**With only T1_risk_on_off_regime loaded:**

Very strong contribution. This is the foundational framework for Case 03. Agent produces signal-to-regime mapping, identifies transition zone, articulates asymmetric transition speeds.

| Dimension | Score | vs Full-T1 |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Causal Explicitness | 5 | 0 |
| Assumption Clarity | 4 | 0 |
| Actionability | 4 | -1 |

**Marginal contribution to Case 03**: 85%

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg Marginal Contribution | **48%** |
| Independence | MEDIUM |
| Synergy with | T1_correlation_regime_shift |
| Cases where critical | 1/3 (Case 03) |

## Recommendation

**CONTEXTUAL** - Confirmed. Trigger: regime_ambiguity_detected.
High value when applicable, but not universally needed.
