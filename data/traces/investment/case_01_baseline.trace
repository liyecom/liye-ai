# Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

The stock has rallied 15% in the past month leading up to earnings.

## Task

Assess the risk profile of this situation.

## Agent Output (Baseline)

### Risk Assessment

The situation presents several risks to consider:

**1. Valuation Risk**
The stock has already rallied 15% ahead of earnings. If earnings meet or slightly beat expectations, the upside may be limited since much of the good news appears priced in.

**2. Volatility Risk**
Earnings events typically create volatility. The options market is pricing in significant movement, which could go either way.

**3. Execution Risk**
Even with strong earnings, guidance or other factors (margins, revenue mix) could disappoint investors.

**4. Market Sentiment Risk**
Overall market conditions could overshadow company-specific results.

### Conclusion

The risk profile is moderately elevated due to the pre-earnings rally and high expectations. Investors should be prepared for potential downside even if earnings beat consensus.
