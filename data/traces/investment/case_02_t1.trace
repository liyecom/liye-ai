# Case 02: Portfolio Hidden Risk Exposure Diagnosis

## Scenario

A portfolio holds:
- 40% US large-cap equities (S&P 500 ETF)
- 30% Investment-grade corporate bonds
- 20% Emerging market equities
- 10% Gold

The portfolio manager believes this is "well-diversified" based on historical correlation data from 2010-2019.

## Task

Diagnose hidden risk exposures in this portfolio.

### Hidden Risk Diagnosis

#### Critical Flaw: Correlation Regime Dependency

The portfolio's diversification assumption is built on 2010-2019 correlation data. This period represents a **single regime** (post-GFC recovery, QE-supported, low volatility). The assumption fails under regime shift.

**Causal Chain of Failure:**
1. Stress event triggers (e.g., liquidity crisis, rate shock) → Flight to safety
2. Flight to safety → Forced selling across asset classes
3. Forced selling → All correlations converge toward 1.0
4. Correlation convergence → Diversification benefit disappears
5. Portfolio volatility spikes beyond historical VaR

**Quantified Exposure:**
| Asset Class | 2010-2019 Corr to SPX | 2008 Crisis Corr to SPX |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| IG Corporate | 0.15 | 0.75 |
| EM Equity | 0.65 | 0.92 |
| Gold | -0.10 | 0.25 (early crisis) |

**Implication:** Under stress, 90% of the portfolio moves together. The "40/30/20/10" structure becomes effectively "90% risk-on / 10% gold."

#### Hidden Risk #1: Liquidity Illusion

The IG corporate bond and EM equity allocations assume normal-condition liquidity.

**Mechanism:**
- Calm conditions → Dealers provide tight spreads → Manager assumes liquidity is real
- Stress event → Dealers widen spreads 5-10x or withdraw
- Manager needs to rebalance or de-risk → Transaction costs spike
- High costs → Delayed action → Losses compound

**Boundary Condition:** This applies particularly to IG corporates, which are dealer-intermediated rather than exchange-traded. The ETF wrapper provides daily liquidity but at potentially severe NAV discount.

#### Hidden Risk #2: Reflexive Deleveraging

If the portfolio uses any leverage (margin, levered ETFs, or is part of a larger levered structure):

**Causal Chain:**
1. Price decline → Collateral value impaired
2. Impaired collateral → Margin call or credit tightening
3. Forced selling → Further price decline
4. Negative feedback loop until equity or intervention

**Even without explicit leverage:** The EM allocation may be exposed to reflexive dynamics in EM countries where local corporates have USD debt. EM selloff → currency depreciation → increased debt burden → further selloff.

#### Hidden Risk #3: Risk-On/Off Binary

The portfolio structure assumes continuous risk gradation. Reality operates in two regimes:

| Regime | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Risk-On | SPX, IG Corp, EM all rise together; Gold lags |
| Risk-Off | SPX, IG Corp, EM all fall together; Gold may rise but insufficient |

**Implication:** In risk-off, the 10% gold cannot offset the 90% decline. The portfolio is structurally long "risk-on regime persistence."

### Risk Exposure Summary

| Hidden Risk | Mechanism | Severity |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Correlation regime shift | All correlations → 1.0 under stress | CRITICAL |
| Liquidity illusion | Spreads widen when needed most | HIGH |
| Reflexive EM exposure | USD debt feedback loop | MEDIUM |
| Risk-on regime dependency | 90/10 binary structure | HIGH |

### Falsifiable Predictions

1. During next VIX > 35 event, realized 30-day correlation between SPX and IG Corp will exceed 0.60
2. Bid-ask spreads on IG corporate bond ETFs will widen >3x during stress vs. calm periods
3. EM equity drawdown will exceed SPX drawdown by >1.5x during global risk-off events
