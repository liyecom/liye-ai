# Case 03: Risk-On vs Risk-Off Regime Trade-off

## Scenario

Current market conditions:
- VIX at 22 (elevated but not extreme)
- 10Y Treasury yield rising
- Credit spreads widening modestly
- USD strengthening against EM currencies
- Equity markets down 5% from recent highs

## Task

Analyze the trade-off between maintaining risk exposure versus reducing risk in the current regime.

### Regime Diagnosis

#### Signal Interpretation Framework

Markets operate in two primary regimes with distinct behavior patterns. The current signals must be interpreted as **regime indicators**, not isolated data points.

**Signal Mapping:**

| Signal | Risk-On Regime | Risk-Off Regime | Current |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| VIX | < 15 | > 25-30 | 22 (transition zone) |
| Credit spreads | Tightening | Widening | WIDENING ⚠️ |
| USD vs EM | Stable/Weak | Strengthening | STRENGTHENING ⚠️ |
| Treasury yields | Rising (growth) | Rising (flight) or Falling | RISING (ambiguous) |
| Equity from high | < 3% | > 10% | 5% (transition zone) |

**Regime Assessment:** 3/5 signals indicate risk-off transition. The system is in the **transition zone**, not yet full risk-off but exhibiting early warning signals.

#### Critical Insight: Regime Transition Asymmetry

**Mechanism:**
- Risk-on → Risk-off transition: FAST (days to weeks)
- Risk-off → Risk-on transition: SLOW (weeks to months)

**Causal Chain of Risk-Off Cascade:**
1. Initial stress (current 5% decline) → Some investors reduce
2. Reduction → Selling pressure → Spreads widen further
3. Spread widening → Triggers risk models → More forced selling
4. Forced selling → VIX spikes above 30 → Full risk-off regime
5. Full risk-off → Correlations converge → Diversification fails

**Implication:** If you wait for confirmation (VIX > 30), the transition has already occurred and exit costs are elevated.

#### Trade-off Structure

**Option A: Maintain Risk Exposure**

| Scenario | Probability | Outcome |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| False alarm, reversion | 40% | +5-10% recovery |
| Slow grind, no resolution | 30% | ±3% chop |
| Full risk-off cascade | 30% | -15-25% drawdown |

**Expected value:** Moderately negative due to asymmetric downside.

**Option B: Reduce Risk Now**

| Scenario | Probability | Outcome |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Miss rebound | 40% | Opportunity cost 5-10% |
| Neutral, re-enter later | 30% | Minor transaction cost |
| Avoid cascade | 30% | Avoid -15-25% drawdown |

**Expected value:** Slightly positive due to tail protection.

#### Liquidity Timing Constraint

**Current condition:** Liquidity is still adequate (VIX 22 = spreads reasonable).

**Mechanism insight:** The liquidity that exists now will **not exist** when you most need it. If you decide to reduce risk:
- Execute NOW while spreads are normal
- Do NOT wait for confirmation
- Confirmation = VIX > 30 = spreads widened 3-5x = adverse execution

**Boundary Condition:** This applies to positions in credit, EM, and less liquid equities. Large-cap equity ETFs maintain liquidity better but still face elevated costs during stress.

#### Decision Framework

| Factor | Weight | Favor Reduce | Favor Maintain |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Signal cluster | 30% | ✓ (3/5 risk-off) | |
| Regime transition asymmetry | 25% | ✓ (fast down, slow up) | |
| Liquidity timing | 20% | ✓ (execute now vs. later) | |
| Opportunity cost | 15% | | ✓ (miss rebound) |
| Fundamental view | 10% | Depends | Depends |

**Weighted assessment:** 75% of structural factors favor risk reduction.

### Trade-off Verdict

The structural trade-off is asymmetric:
- **Upside of maintaining risk:** Capture potential +5-10% rebound (40% probability)
- **Downside of maintaining risk:** Endure -15-25% cascade (30% probability)
- **Cost of reducing risk:** Transaction costs + potential opportunity cost
- **Benefit of reducing risk:** Tail protection + optionality to re-enter

**Mechanism-based conclusion:** The regime transition signals, combined with liquidity timing constraints and information decay asymmetry, structurally favor risk reduction despite uncertainty about the outcome.

### Falsifiable Predictions

1. If VIX exceeds 30 within 2 weeks, IG credit spreads will have widened >50bps from current levels
2. If full risk-off occurs, EM equity drawdown will exceed 1.5x S&P drawdown
3. Exit execution costs (bid-ask + market impact) will be 3-5x higher during VIX > 35 vs. current VIX 22
