# Case 01: Event-driven Risk Assessment

## Scenario

A major tech company is about to report quarterly earnings.
Options market implies 85% probability of beating consensus estimates.
The stock has rallied 15% in the past month leading up to earnings.

## Task

Assess the risk profile of this situation.

### Risk Profile Analysis

#### Core Mechanism: Expectation Saturation

The 85% implied probability of a beat represents a critical threshold. When market-implied probability exceeds ~70%, a structural asymmetry emerges:

**Causal Chain:**
1. High implied probability (85%) → Market has pre-positioned for positive outcome
2. Pre-positioning (15% rally) → Marginal buyers already deployed capital
3. If earnings beat as expected → No information surprise, no new buyers
4. Absence of marginal demand → Selling pressure from profit-taking
5. Result: Stock declines despite "good" earnings

**Boundary Conditions:**
- This mechanism applies because: (a) binary event with clear outcome, (b) sufficient liquidity for pre-positioning, (c) observable implied probability via options
- Would break down if: earnings significantly exceed (not just meet) expectations, creating genuine surprise

#### Secondary Risk: Information Asymmetry in Reaction Speed

If earnings disappoint (15% probability), the price reaction will be:
- Rapid: Full incorporation in 1-2 trading sessions
- Severe: Pre-positioned longs forced to exit simultaneously

If earnings beat (85% probability), the price reaction will be:
- Muted: "As expected" generates no urgency
- Gradual: Any further upside requires new catalyst

**Implication:** The payoff is asymmetric. Downside is fast and sharp; upside is slow and capped.

#### Liquidity Consideration

The 15% pre-earnings rally indicates crowded positioning. During the earnings release window:
- Apparent liquidity (tight spreads during normal trading) may evaporate
- Transaction costs spike during high-volatility window
- Forced sellers face adverse execution

### Risk Profile Summary

| Risk Dimension | Assessment | Mechanism |
|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Downside on beat | HIGH | Expectation saturation |
| Downside on miss | SEVERE | Asymmetric info decay |
| Upside potential | CAPPED | Pre-positioning exhaustion |
| Liquidity risk | ELEVATED | Event-driven spread widening |

### Conclusion

The risk profile is structurally unfavorable. The 85% implied probability creates a paradox: the more likely a beat, the less valuable it becomes. The causal chain from expectation saturation predicts neutral-to-negative reaction on a meet/beat, and severe reaction on a miss.

**Falsifiable prediction:** If earnings beat consensus by <5%, expect flat-to-negative price action within 48 hours despite "positive" headline.
