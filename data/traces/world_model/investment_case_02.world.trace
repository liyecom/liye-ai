  pattern_description: |
    The current state shows ELEVATED uncertainty with SATURATED expectations
    and TIGHT liquidity. Acceleration is not detected. Amplification potential
    is uncertain. The system may be near phase boundaries in expectation and
    liquidity dimensions.

    This describes current form, not future trajectory.

    This trace describes:
    1. What can fail under stress (T1)
    2. What dangerous state the world is in now (T2)
    3. How that state might be evolving (T3)

    It does NOT tell you what to do.
    It ensures you cannot ignore what the world actually is.
