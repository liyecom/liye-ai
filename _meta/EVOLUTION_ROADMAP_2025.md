## 🔄 Evolution Principles

**1. Dogfooding**
- Every tool we build must be useful for LiYe OS itself
- If we don't use it daily, question its value

**2. Compound Growth**
- Each project should make future projects easier
- Build reusable components
- Document patterns

**3. Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with CLI, add UI later
- Start with manual, automate gradually
- Start with simple, add intelligence incrementally

**4. Knowledge First**
- Code is temporary, knowledge is permanent
- Always capture insights via `/evolve`
- Update PARA indexes continuously
- Document decisions

**5. Dual-Engine Leverage**
- Use Claude Code for strategy, quality, integration
- Use Antigravity for speed, parallelism, prototyping
- Never do manually what AI can do
